## ParticlesShowcase

This is a small project where I tested the viability of [react-three-fiver], by comparing the code with and without react-three-fiver. It also has the purpose of getting familiar with said library. 

>To see the the code comparison, please refer to the `/pages/index.jsx` file and the `/pages/fiver.jsx` file. 

You can see the production build [here].
